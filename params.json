{"name":"Corpus","tagline":"Organize and Analyze Linguistic Data","body":"*Corpus is a language documentation notebook for doing linguistic data analysis that is intended to be aproachable for a non-technical user.*\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThanks for checking this project out. We want to build a platform agnostic and (one day) feature rich alternative to [FLEx](https://github.com/sillsdev/FieldWorks) with [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/) and [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron). We're calling this tool *Corpus* most of the time, and *Glossa* sometimes too.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the standard software for lexicography is [FLEx](https://github.com/sillsdev/FieldWorks), and... well... nothing else. this is SIL's Application for Windows/.NET, and is clunky and old... but does work. The app is free, and open source!\r\n\r\n\r\n## FieldWorks / FLEx\r\n ![The Current Standard, on Window 10](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/538337/Screen%20Shot%202016-01-11%20at%203.36.51%20PM.png)\r\n\r\n> The FLEx (FieldWorks) Application does everything we need it to do, but is dated, and in desperate need of an overhaul.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Corpus / Glossa\r\n\r\n![What we're imagining](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/538337/Screen%20Shot%202016-01-11%20at%203.10.24%20PM.png)\r\n\r\n> See our [Proto.io Prototype](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/538337/Glossa-Prototype/frame.html) for a really rough UX Mock-up of what we are imagining... a sleek, refined user experience across platforms, and even online. One codebase and as future-proof as possible.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThanks again for your time.
